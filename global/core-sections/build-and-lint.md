## Build & Lint
- Run lint/format scripts after implementation, scoped to modified files only — not the entire codebase.
- **Lint/format covers every modified file a formatter owns — not just code.** Biome/Prettier reflow CSS, JSON, Markdown, YAML, and config too; never treat a change as "just CSS/docs" and skip the run. Before pushing to any repo whose CI gates lint/format, run the repo's lint (or `format --write`) over the touched files and confirm clean FIRST — a formatter reflow CI would reject (e.g. wrapping a long CSS value) is precisely what the local run catches, and the pre-push reminder hook is not a substitute for actually running it.
- **Build must pass before task completion.** Run the project's build command after implementation. A task that breaks the build is not complete — fix before proceeding. Do not defer build verification to a later task or to the user. If no build command is configured, skip and note it.
- **Scale the build gate to the change.** A trivial/localized change → a fast typecheck (`tsc --noEmit`, `mypy`) is the local verification; reserve the full production build for build-graph changes (config, routes, deps, assets) and the CI/pre-deploy gate. "Build must pass" means don't *ship* a broken build, not run the heaviest command on every one-line fix. Proportionality canon: `testing.md > Execution Scope`.
