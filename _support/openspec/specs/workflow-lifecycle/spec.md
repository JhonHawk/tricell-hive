# workflow-lifecycle

## Purpose

The lifecycle of authorized work, its viewer record and deferred session hygiene.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Viewer finalization before deferred hygiene

The normal completion phase SHALL publish and read back the viewer's actual terminal or waiting lifecycle before the report's hygiene footer. Integrated or abandoned completed work SHALL close explicitly; a ready/human-review stop SHALL remain in_review, a real pause SHALL remain paused, and awaiting validation SHALL remain explicit. Support-material decisions, change-record archival and resource/branch cleanup MAY remain deferred without keeping a completed viewer record active. A later hygiene phase SHALL NOT duplicate an already confirmed closure. The procedure SHALL preserve the change-folder commit and intentional-pending-work rules of the prerequisite #311 candidate.

An unavailable viewer or missing producer authority SHALL preserve inputs, report the still-recorded state and continue independent work without starting the service, silently recovering authority or claiming a successful close. Upload cleanup SHALL retain its exact committed-readback requirement.

#### Scenario: Delivered work awaits optional cleanup
- WHEN authorized work reaches its completion point and the viewer accepts its close
- THEN the initial report observes the work closed while the hygiene footer can still wait for the user.

#### Scenario: An open pull request waits for merge
- WHEN delivery stops ready for the user's merge
- THEN the viewer remains in_review and is not made eligible for terminal autoarchive.

#### Scenario: Later hygiene
- WHEN the user requests the deferred hygiene
- THEN its support/archive/cleanup steps use the previous closure evidence without appending another closure.

### Requirement: Tickets follow the tracker their key declares
When a repository's `## Hive` declares `Other trackers`, the workflow guidance SHALL read and search tickets in every declared tracker, SHALL move and comment each ticket in the tracker that declares its key prefix, using the primary `Tracker` for a key no tracker declares, and SHALL create new tickets only in the primary tracker. Declaring a tracker in `## Hive` SHALL authorize those moves and comments as it does for the primary tracker.

#### Scenario: Ticket of an additional tracker reaches a later environment
- **WHEN** a deployment is verified and `Completion` holds a value for the prefix `XYZ`
- **THEN** the guidance moves each `XYZ-` ticket whose change that ref holds to the declared state in the tracker that declares `XYZ`.

#### Scenario: Mirror tickets
- **WHEN** one work item names a ticket in the primary tracker and another in an additional tracker
- **THEN** the guidance moves and comments both, each in its own tracker.

#### Scenario: New ticket
- **WHEN** a flow proposes or creates a ticket in a repository with additional trackers
- **THEN** it searches every declared tracker for an existing one and creates the new ticket in the primary tracker.

### Requirement: UX review in one pass

A UI change's `hive-review-ux` child SHALL receive, with the walk's captures, the means to reach each state its role always checks, or the states that cannot be reached. It SHALL list a state it cannot reach as not covered instead of failing its verdict. Its verdict SHALL judge only the defects the change introduced in the reviewed regions: passed when the reviewed states show no introduced defect of any priority, and not passed when no state could be reviewed. Defects already there SHALL be reported in a separate list. A correction of one of its findings SHALL be reread by a follow-up limited to the corrected regions, the layouts that contain them and their loading, empty and error states, with the automated audit and the layout, keyboard, focus and accessible-name checks on the longest values, never by a new full UX review. In a deployment walk, the reviewer SHALL get the same brief with the environment's URLs in place of the captures.

#### Scenario: State the brief cannot reach

- **GIVEN** a UI change whose error state needs a fixture the brief does not provide
- **WHEN** the UX reviewer cannot reach that state
- **THEN** it lists the state as not covered with what blocked it, and its verdict covers the reviewed states
- **AND** the producer covers that state in its own walk or reports it as not verified, in the validation round or, when the delivery does not stop for validation, in the final report

#### Scenario: Deployment walk

- **GIVEN** a deployment walk of a UI change
- **WHEN** the producer launches the UX reviewer alongside the functional walk
- **THEN** its brief follows the reviewer brief with the environment's URLs in place of the captures, and the reviewer takes its own captures

#### Scenario: Defect already there

- **GIVEN** a reviewed region with a P3 defect that the base branch already shows
- **WHEN** the reviewer finds no defect the change introduced
- **THEN** the verdict is passed and the P3 defect appears in the list of defects already there, with its priority
- **AND** the defect reaches the user in the validation round or, when the delivery does not stop for validation, in the close's findings

#### Scenario: No state could be reviewed

- **GIVEN** a UX review whose brief gives no reachable state
- **WHEN** the reviewer cannot review any state
- **THEN** the verdict is not passed and the report says the review did not run

#### Scenario: Correction of a UX finding

- **GIVEN** the producer fixed a defect the UX reviewer reported
- **WHEN** the fix is reread
- **THEN** the same child reviews only the corrected regions and states, the layouts that contain them and their loading, empty and error states, still running the automated audit and the measured checks with the longest values, and answers in one reply
- **AND** when the host has no tool to message that child, or the message returns an error, a new UX reviewer gets the corrected findings and only those regions and states

### Requirement: Archived change order within a day

Closing an integrated change folder SHALL move it to `<Specs>/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<change-id>/`, with the UTC date and 24-hour time of the archive, so that two changes archived the same day keep their order. The spec-delta check SHALL require the delta of the latest folder of each requirement, ordering same-day folders by that time when both carry it, and SHALL accept either delta only when their order is unknown: on the same day when a folder has no time or both carry the same time, or when a folder without a time, which carries the local date of the older convention, and a timed one are at most a day apart. A requirement that one delta lists more than once SHALL be reported while that folder holds the latest delta of the requirement, and its blocks SHALL take part in no comparison.

#### Scenario: Two changes archived the same day

- **GIVEN** `2026-11-04-1403-a` and `2026-11-04-2003-b` both modify one requirement
- **WHEN** the spec matches the delta of `2026-11-04-1403-a`
- **THEN** the check reports that the spec differs from the delta of `2026-11-04-2003-b`

#### Scenario: Same-day folder without a time

- **GIVEN** `2026-11-04-a` and `2026-11-04-b`, without a time, both modify one requirement
- **WHEN** the spec matches either delta
- **THEN** the check reports nothing for that requirement

#### Scenario: Superseded duplicate

- **GIVEN** a folder lists a requirement twice and a later folder modifies it
- **WHEN** the spec matches the later delta
- **THEN** the check reports nothing for that requirement
