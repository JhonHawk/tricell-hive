# workflow-lifecycle

## Purpose

The lifecycle of authorized work, its viewer record and deferred session hygiene.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Viewer finalization before deferred hygiene

The normal completion phase SHALL publish and read back the viewer's actual terminal or waiting lifecycle before the report's hygiene footer. Integrated or abandoned completed work SHALL close explicitly; a ready/human-review stop SHALL remain in_review, a real pause SHALL remain paused, and awaiting validation SHALL remain explicit. Support-material decisions, change-record archival and resource/branch cleanup MAY remain deferred without keeping a completed viewer record active. A later hygiene phase SHALL NOT duplicate an already confirmed closure. The procedure SHALL preserve the change-folder commit and intentional-pending-work rules of the prerequisite #311 candidate.

An unavailable viewer or missing producer authority SHALL preserve inputs, report the still-recorded state and continue independent work without starting the service, silently recovering authority or claiming a successful close. Upload cleanup SHALL retain its exact committed-readback requirement.

#### Scenario: Delivered work awaits optional cleanup
- WHEN authorized work reaches its completion point and the viewer accepts its close
- THEN the initial report observes the work closed while the hygiene footer can still wait for the user.

#### Scenario: An open pull request waits for merge
- WHEN delivery stops ready for the user's merge
- THEN the viewer remains in_review and is not made eligible for terminal autoarchive.

#### Scenario: Later hygiene
- WHEN the user requests the deferred hygiene
- THEN its support/archive/cleanup steps use the previous closure evidence without appending another closure.

### Requirement: Tickets follow the tracker their key declares
When a repository's `## Hive` declares `Other trackers`, the workflow guidance SHALL read and search tickets in every declared tracker, SHALL move and comment each ticket in the tracker that declares its key prefix, using the primary `Tracker` for a key no tracker declares, and SHALL create new tickets only in the primary tracker. Declaring a tracker in `## Hive` SHALL authorize those moves and comments as it does for the primary tracker.

#### Scenario: Ticket of an additional tracker reaches a later environment
- **WHEN** a deployment is verified and `Completion` holds a value for the prefix `XYZ`
- **THEN** the guidance moves each `XYZ-` ticket whose change that ref holds to the declared state in the tracker that declares `XYZ`.

#### Scenario: Mirror tickets
- **WHEN** one work item names a ticket in the primary tracker and another in an additional tracker
- **THEN** the guidance moves and comments both, each in its own tracker.

#### Scenario: New ticket
- **WHEN** a flow proposes or creates a ticket in a repository with additional trackers
- **THEN** it searches every declared tracker for an existing one and creates the new ticket in the primary tracker.
