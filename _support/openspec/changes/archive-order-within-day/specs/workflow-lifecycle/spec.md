# Delta for workflow-lifecycle

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Archived change order within a day

Closing an integrated change folder SHALL move it to `<Specs>/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<change-id>/`, with the UTC date and 24-hour time of the archive, so that two changes archived the same day keep their order. The spec-delta check SHALL require the delta of the latest folder of each requirement, ordering same-day folders by that time when both carry it, and SHALL accept either delta only when their order is unknown: on the same day when a folder has no time or both carry the same time, or when a folder without a time, which carries the local date of the older convention, and a timed one are at most a day apart. A requirement that one delta lists more than once SHALL be reported while that folder holds the latest delta of the requirement, and its blocks SHALL take part in no comparison.

#### Scenario: Two changes archived the same day

- **GIVEN** `2026-11-04-1403-a` and `2026-11-04-2003-b` both modify one requirement
- **WHEN** the spec matches the delta of `2026-11-04-1403-a`
- **THEN** the check reports that the spec differs from the delta of `2026-11-04-2003-b`

#### Scenario: Same-day folder without a time

- **GIVEN** `2026-11-04-a` and `2026-11-04-b`, without a time, both modify one requirement
- **WHEN** the spec matches either delta
- **THEN** the check reports nothing for that requirement

#### Scenario: Superseded duplicate

- **GIVEN** a folder lists a requirement twice and a later folder modifies it
- **WHEN** the spec matches the later delta
- **THEN** the check reports nothing for that requirement
