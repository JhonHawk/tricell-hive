## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Screen proposals in Figma before the plan

Screen examples SHALL be drawn by a stage of their own, `flow-figma-design`, that runs between research and the plan and that only the user's reply starts, except the continuation from research for a request whose deliverable is the design. When the host has a connection that can write to Figma, research SHALL end with the next-step block that recommends that stage, with going straight to the plan, or to the build for a small understood change, as other replies, when what gets built includes a new screen, even when sibling screens fix its composition and the change would otherwise continue into the build, and when it changes an existing screen by adding, removing or moving a region and neither the request nor an existing screen fixes that composition; this SHALL hold when research assessed a ticket the user picked as well as when the user asked for a change. Research SHALL NOT mention the stage for a change that keeps the screen's layout, on a host with no connection that can write to Figma, or under unattended delegation, and SHALL make no offer of proposals through a question. The user's reply that starts the stage SHALL be the instruction for the writes it makes to that Figma file, limited to what the work creates, and SHALL NOT replace the question a critical effect takes. On a host with no connection that can write to Figma, the stage SHALL draw nothing and report what is missing. The stage SHALL load the Figma connection's own usage instructions, when it ships them, the project's design system, the sibling screens of the same module or navigation in the file and in the code, and the decisions already recorded for the app in its design record and in the `UI` sections of the project's change folders, before it draws. It SHALL draw in the Figma file the user named in the conversation or the app's design record declares; a declared file of another design tool SHALL NOT count, and a declared file that neither the block that offered the stage nor the user named SHALL be confirmed by the user once before the first write. When the connection cannot write to that file, the stage SHALL draw nothing and report it. With neither file, it SHALL ask the user for the file once, in the text, and end with the route to the plan when the user gives none. Before the first drawing it SHALL tell the user each step they will have to take by hand in Figma. It SHALL draw one example per screen, following its sibling screens, and SHALL draw two or three examples only for a screen the user names when asking for alternatives, as frames on a page named after the work, and SHALL change or delete only the nodes the work created; it MAY create components and variables local to the file, SHALL record their identifiers with the example, and SHALL remove those only the unchosen examples used; a change to an existing variable, style or component, or to a shared library, SHALL return to the user as a decision. The main thread SHALL draw the frames; no child SHALL draw them. When the connection runs scripts in the file, each write SHALL define once the pieces its frames use, built on the tool's automatic layout and bound to the file's variables, with the app shell cloned from an existing screen, and SHALL compose the frames from them; a correction SHALL change a piece or the data and draw the frame again, not move or resize nodes one by one. Examples SHALL be drawn at one desktop width, the one the screen's existing frames in the file use, otherwise 1440 px. The record SHALL be written as soon as the frames are drawn, with a status saying they are under review. Before the user is asked, one `hive-review-ux` child SHALL review the first drawing, and one the 440 px frame, against the request, the sibling screens, the recorded decisions and their alignment, without the drawer's reasoning; without a connection that reads the file, it SHALL judge from the frames' images and report the alignment measurements as not run, and the stage SHALL say so in the approval message. The main thread SHALL fix the findings that hold, have only the corrected frames reviewed again once, update the record's status to pending the user's approval, and name what remains in the message to the user. A correction the user asks for SHALL NOT get another review. The user SHALL choose or correct an example as a decision, approving or correcting it when there is only one, and SHALL approve the 440 px frame of a screen served on mobile before it is recorded. When the user's correction sets a convention that applies beyond that screen, the stage SHALL ask once, in the round that asks the approval, whether to record it among the decisions of the app's design record, and SHALL keep a yes in the example's record without editing the design record itself. The approved example SHALL be recorded in the report and in a note of the work's support folder with the file's location, each frame's node, a local image and its status; that note SHALL be written as soon as the examples are drawn, before the review and before the user is asked, and its status SHALL be updated after the review and when the user approves. A plan SHALL treat only a record whose status is approved as an approved example; the examples not chosen SHALL be removed. When the file is not declared in the app's design record, the stage SHALL ask once, in the round that asks the approval, whether to record it there, and SHALL keep a yes in the example's record without editing the design record itself. For a request whose deliverable is the design, research SHALL continue into the stage in the same turn when the host has a connection that can write to Figma, and SHALL report the missing connection as a blocker when it has none. The stage SHALL end with the next-step block toward the plan, except for a request whose deliverable is the design, which ends as this requirement sets for it. A request whose deliverable is the design SHALL be drawn by the same stage, in the page or frames it names when it names them, changing and never deleting those frames; it SHALL NOT be reported as done before the user approves the example, and after that approval the stage SHALL name as pending each yes to recording the file or a convention in the design record, since no plan follows to write it, and SHALL run the close, which treats it as an operational task. Under unattended delegation the stage SHALL ask neither for the file nor for the confirmation of a declared one, SHALL draw nothing and report the file as unresolved when it has none it may use, the choice or the approval of an example SHALL stay unanswered and be reported as unresolved, every example SHALL be kept, and the plan SHALL settle the UI without an approved example. A plan with a change folder SHALL carry the approved example's record in its `UI` section, and work without one in its checkpoint file. A plan for the screen SHALL use the approved example as the after sketch of the regions it shows, SHALL add the task that writes each convention the record holds a yes for, and the build's first view, the verification walk and the UX review SHALL compare the rendered screen against it. A difference SHALL be a region, a component, an action's placement or an order that differs from the example, not rendering variance, and not what the plan records as decided otherwise or a correction the user asked for after approving the example, which the example's record SHALL name; it SHALL be handled as a UI defect the change introduced, and the differences that remain SHALL be listed in the validation message when the delivery stops for validation and in the final report when it does not. When a frame's image is missing where the comparison runs, the frame SHALL be read again from its recorded location and node, and a comparison that cannot run SHALL be reported as not run. The user's validation in verification SHALL be asked as before.

#### Scenario: A ticket with a new screen and a Figma connection

- **GIVEN** a host whose connection can write to Figma
- **WHEN** research assesses a ticket whose work includes a new screen, whether or not sibling screens fix its composition
- **THEN** its next-step block recommends `flow-figma-design` and lists going straight to the plan as another reply
- **AND** it asks no question that offers proposals

#### Scenario: A requested change for a new screen whose siblings fix its layout

- **GIVEN** a host whose connection can write to Figma, and a requested new list screen whose sibling screens fix its layout
- **WHEN** research finds the how leaves no decision for the user
- **THEN** it ends with the next-step block that recommends `flow-figma-design`, with the build as another reply, instead of continuing into the build

#### Scenario: No Figma connection

- **GIVEN** a host with no connection that can write to Figma
- **WHEN** research reaches a new screen
- **THEN** it does not mention the stage and routes to the plan, which draws its text sketches

#### Scenario: A change that keeps the layout

- **GIVEN** a request to change a button, a copy, a field or a column of an existing screen
- **WHEN** research settles what the work is
- **THEN** it does not mention the stage

#### Scenario: One example that follows its siblings

- **GIVEN** a new list screen in a module whose other screens already exist in the Figma file
- **WHEN** the stage draws it without the user asking for alternatives
- **THEN** the main thread draws one example whose shell, header, toolbar, table and row actions follow those sibling screens
- **AND** no child draws it

#### Scenario: Alternatives the user asks for

- **GIVEN** a flow of several screens
- **WHEN** the user asks for alternatives for one screen they name
- **THEN** the stage draws two or three examples for that screen and one for each of the others

#### Scenario: Review before the user sees the frames

- **GIVEN** frames the main thread has drawn
- **WHEN** the stage is about to write the record and ask the user
- **THEN** the record already lists the frames with a status saying they are under review
- **AND** one `hive-review-ux` child has reviewed them against the request, the sibling screens, the recorded decisions and their alignment
- **AND** the findings that hold are fixed, and the ones that remain are named in the message to the user

#### Scenario: A convention the user corrects

- **GIVEN** a user who corrects the row actions of an example to icon buttons with a tooltip, for every list of the app
- **WHEN** the stage asks the approval
- **THEN** it asks in the same round whether to record that convention among the decisions of the app's design record
- **AND** on a yes the plan for that screen includes the task that writes it

#### Scenario: The design file is not declared

- **GIVEN** an app whose design record declares no design file, and a user who has named none
- **WHEN** the stage starts
- **THEN** it asks the user once for the file
- **AND** when the user gives none, it ends with the route to the plan

#### Scenario: The request is the design

- **GIVEN** a request to draw or replicate a screen in Figma
- **WHEN** the stage draws the example
- **THEN** it asks the user to approve or correct the example before reporting the work as done
- **AND** after the approval it runs the close

#### Scenario: The user approves an example

- **GIVEN** examples drawn as frames on the work's page
- **WHEN** the user approves one
- **THEN** its record holds the file's location, each frame's node, a local image and the approved status
- **AND** the examples not chosen are removed

#### Scenario: The built screen differs from the approved example

- **GIVEN** work whose record holds an approved example
- **WHEN** the verification walk captures a region the example shows
- **THEN** each difference in a region, a component, an action's placement or an order is handled as a UI defect the change introduced
- **AND** the differences that remain are listed in the validation message, or in the final report when the delivery does not stop for validation

#### Scenario: Unattended delegation is active

- **GIVEN** work that runs under unattended delegation
- **WHEN** research reaches a new screen
- **THEN** it does not recommend the stage and the plan settles the UI
