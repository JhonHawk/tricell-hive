## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Close cleanup sweeps the repositories the work touched
The close's branch cleanup SHALL run in each repository where the work created a branch, a worktree or a commit or wrote its change folder, plus the repository that holds `Specs`; a hygiene request SHALL cover the current repository, its `Specs` repository and the repositories that the pending-close records in persistent memory name. Every worktree removal SHALL keep the worktree and both copies of its branch when it has uncommitted or untracked files, or an ignored entry other than these three: a dependency or build folder or an entry in one; an entry whose content the main checkout of the worktree's own repository already holds at the same path; and, at any depth, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `next-env.d.ts`, `*.pyc`, `.turbo/`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/` or `.DS_Store`, or an entry inside one of those folders; it SHALL first stop the processes the work started inside its own worktree, by process ID, and SHALL keep any worktree where a running process has its working directory or where that cannot be checked. A squash- or rebase-merged branch SHALL count as merged only when its pull request's `headRefOid` equals the head of each local and remote copy to be deleted; a remote copy that moved SHALL be reported with the commits after that head. After the work's own branch, the sweep SHALL check the other branches whose pull requests the user authored and merged into the base, the local branches `git branch --merged` lists that persistent memory records for the user's earlier work in a repository without pull requests, and the temporary or preview branches the work created. It SHALL NOT switch any checkout's branch, and SHALL keep, reporting the reason, a branch checked out in another checkout and a branch that persistent memory records for work whose close is not recorded as done, unless a pending-close record for that work is older than 24 hours, in which case it SHALL resume that work's pending close steps in order instead of removing its branch or worktree. The global guidance SHALL authorize deleting merged work branches from this work or the user's earlier work in those repositories, with their clean worktrees, and SHALL keep forbidding the deletion of unmerged branches and of worktrees with uncommitted or untracked files. The deferral of cleanup to the close footer's reply SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: A leftover worktree of earlier work
- **WHEN** a close or hygiene request runs and the specs repository holds a clean worktree whose branch the user merged into the base in earlier work whose pending close is older than 24 hours
- **THEN** that work's pending close steps run in order, including its support decision, and its worktree and branch are removed by its own cleanup

#### Scenario: A merged worktree with only disposable ignored entries
- **WHEN** a merged branch's clean worktree holds only ignored `__pycache__/`, `.DS_Store` and a `.env` identical to the main checkout's
- **THEN** the cleanup removes the worktree and deletes both copies of its branch

#### Scenario: A worktree still in use
- **WHEN** a merged branch's worktree is the working directory of a running process, holds an ignored entry other than those three, or belongs to work in progress or whose close has been pending for less than 24 hours
- **THEN** the cleanup keeps it and reports the reason

#### Scenario: A remote copy moved after the merge
- **WHEN** the remote copy of a merged branch holds a commit pushed after the merged head
- **THEN** that copy is kept and reported with its unmerged commits
