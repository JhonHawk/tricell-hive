## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Read-only diagnostics
The manager SHALL offer read-only diagnostics, both as the `hive doctor` and `hive models` text commands and as the Diagnostics, Models, Integrations, and Project views of the terminal interface, with the same content in both forms. They SHALL report each supported host's detection, version, release, and installation state; every resource whose status is other than `installed`, `retained_shared`, and `not_installed`, and any pending operation; open sessions that probably predate the installed release; the effective model and effort per role and host, marking roles with a model override and listing overrides that are not applied; the local evidence and last onboarding status of Engram, Context7, pi-subagents, and `agent-browser`; when Pi is a registered host, how to keep Pi's `codemode` tool enabled, without checking whether it is; and the validity of a repository's `## Hive` section. `hive doctor`, `hive models` without a subcommand, and the views while no edit is confirmed SHALL NOT write files or state and SHALL NOT read host or provider configuration. They SHALL execute no program other than `--version` of a detected host and read-only `git` queries, except that opening an edit panel in the Models view MAY run that host's model-listing command under the Per-role model overrides requirement. Detecting `agent-browser` SHALL NOT add it to the optional capability catalog. A session marked as predating the installed release SHALL be presented as an estimate, registered hosts whose sessions cannot be observed SHALL show a restart notice instead, except a host whose documentation states that it reloads its instructions, which SHALL say so. Text read from outside the manager SHALL be stripped of control characters before it is shown.

#### Scenario: Stale session
- **WHEN** a Claude Code or Grok session whose process is alive started before the installed release was last written
- **THEN** diagnostics marks it as started before the installed release and suggests restarting it.

#### Scenario: Unreadable session record
- **WHEN** a host's session record is unreadable, larger than 1 MiB, or in an unrecognized format
- **THEN** that host's session check is reported as unavailable with its reason, and the other sections still show.

#### Scenario: Incomplete project section
- **WHEN** a repository's `AGENTS.md` lacks a required `## Hive` value or its `Specs` path does not exist
- **THEN** the Project check names each missing or invalid value and changes nothing.

#### Scenario: Findings do not fail the command
- **WHEN** `hive doctor` finds drift, stale sessions, or an invalid project section
- **THEN** it prints them and exits with status 0.

#### Scenario: Pi codemode guidance without reading Pi
- **WHEN** `hive doctor` runs with Pi registered while Pi's settings already enable `codemode`
- **THEN** the Integrations section shows a `Pi codemode` row that stays `not checked` and whose next step names `"defaultTools": ["+codemode"]`

#### Scenario: No Pi codemode row without Pi
- **WHEN** `hive doctor` runs and Pi is not a registered host
- **THEN** the Integrations section shows no `Pi codemode` row
