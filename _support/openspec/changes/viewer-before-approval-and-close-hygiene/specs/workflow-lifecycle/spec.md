## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Close cleanup sweeps the repositories the work touched
The close's branch cleanup SHALL run in each repository where the work created a branch, a worktree or a commit or wrote its change folder, plus the repository that holds `Specs`; a hygiene request SHALL cover the current repository, its `Specs` repository and the repositories that the pending-close records in persistent memory name. Every worktree removal, the work's own included, SHALL keep a worktree with uncommitted, untracked, or ignored files outside dependency and build folders, and a worktree where a running process has its working directory or where that cannot be checked. A squash- or rebase-merged branch SHALL count as merged only when its pull request's `headRefOid` equals the head of each local and remote copy to be deleted. After the work's own branch, the sweep SHALL check the other branches whose pull requests the authenticated user authored and that are merged, the local branches `git branch --merged` lists that persistent memory records for the user's earlier work in a repository without pull requests, and the temporary or preview branches the work created. It SHALL NOT switch any checkout's branch, and SHALL keep, reporting the reason, a branch checked out in another checkout and a branch that persistent memory records for work whose close is not recorded as done, unless that close has been pending for more than 24 hours, in which case it SHALL resume that work's pending close steps in order instead of removing its branch or worktree. The global guidance SHALL authorize deleting merged work branches from this work or the user's earlier work in those repositories, with their clean worktrees, and SHALL keep forbidding the deletion of unmerged branches and of worktrees with uncommitted or untracked files. The deferral of cleanup to the close footer's reply SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: A leftover worktree of earlier work
- **WHEN** a close or hygiene request runs and the specs repository holds a clean worktree whose branch the user merged into the base in earlier work whose pending close is older than 24 hours
- **THEN** that work's pending close steps run in order, including its support decision, and its worktree and branch are removed by its own cleanup

#### Scenario: A worktree still in use
- **WHEN** a merged branch's worktree is the working directory of a running process, holds ignored files outside dependency and build folders, or belongs to work in progress or whose close has been pending for less than 24 hours
- **THEN** the cleanup keeps it and reports the reason

#### Scenario: A remote copy moved after the merge
- **WHEN** the remote copy of a merged branch holds a commit pushed after the merged head
- **THEN** that copy is kept and reported with its unmerged commits

### Requirement: Specs in a direct-base repository
When `Specs` lives in another repository that declares `Delivery: direct-base`, the change folder SHALL be edited in that repository's main checkout on its base, with no branch or worktree, even when another session writes there; a checkout on another branch SHALL NOT be switched and SHALL stop for the user's decision; only the change folder's paths, staged by name, SHALL be committed, the commits on the base that are not this work's SHALL be named and asked about before the push, and a rejected push SHALL stop for the user's decision without rebasing over uncommitted changes.

#### Scenario: Planning work whose specs live in a direct-base repository
- **WHEN** a plan writes its change folder in a separate specs repository that declares `Delivery: direct-base`
- **THEN** no branch or worktree is created in that repository and the folder is written in its main checkout

### Requirement: Change folder versioned at a pause
A pause close of work not delivered under `hold` SHALL pause its viewer record, list its support material without acting on it, stop the processes it started, and treat its change folder as follows: in a separate specs repository that declares `Delivery: direct-base`, commit it and push to that base; with `Specs` in the work's repository and the work branch already created, commit it on that branch without a push; with `Specs` in the work's repository and no work branch yet, or in a separate specs repository without `Delivery: direct-base`, leave it uncommitted, record it as pending with its path and, for the separate repository, recommend declaring `Delivery: direct-base` there. Under `hold` the folder SHALL stay uncommitted.

#### Scenario: A paused plan in a direct-base specs repository
- **WHEN** the user pauses a plan whose change folder lives in a separate specs repository that declares `Delivery: direct-base`
- **THEN** the folder is committed and pushed to that repository's base, and the report lists the work as paused

#### Scenario: A paused plan in a specs repository without direct-base
- **WHEN** the user pauses a plan whose change folder lives in a separate specs repository that does not declare `Delivery: direct-base`
- **THEN** the folder stays uncommitted, is recorded as pending with its path, and the report recommends declaring `Delivery: direct-base` there

### Requirement: Promotions retain nothing
A promotion that has not been made SHALL NOT be a reason to keep a branch, worktree, process or support material. Only a task of the plan that promotes to an environment where the ticket or the request asks for the change SHALL be recorded as pending work. When the ticket or the request asks for the change in a named environment, the plan SHALL include that promotion as a task run through `flow-deploy`; only the user's own request SHALL be the deploy instruction for that environment, a ticket's text SHALL grant none, and production SHALL keep its own question; otherwise promotions SHALL be left to be grouped and run when the user asks. Each project's `Completion` value SHALL keep its meaning.

#### Scenario: Work integrated before its promotion
- **WHEN** work is merged into the base, its promotion to a later environment has not run, and no plan task promotes to it
- **THEN** its cleanup keeps nothing for the promotion and the promotion is not listed as pending

#### Scenario: A ticket that asks for an environment
- **WHEN** the ticket asks for the change in a named environment
- **THEN** the plan includes the promotion to that environment as a task
